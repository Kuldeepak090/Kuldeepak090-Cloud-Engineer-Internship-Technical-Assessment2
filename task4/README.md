Cost monitoring is crucial for beginners because AWS services are pay-as-you-go, and even small mistakes can generate unexpected charges. 
Enabling alerts helps users track spending and avoid crossing free-tier limits unnoticed. 
Sudden bill increases often occur due to running resources left ON (EC2, RDS, NAT Gateway), high data transfer, misconfigured auto scaling, or accidentally launching non–free-tier services. Monitoring ensures early detection and prevents unnecessary financial surprises.
